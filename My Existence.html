      <p>Social identity, a part of everyone derived from their own place in society.
        My own view of my own identity comes from my experiences with the country I am from, the people around me, 
        beliefs and values.

I like to call it the constantly changing variable of which basic interests and values can be list out.

  <h3>Keeping Track</h3>
  <p>Here's an example of how I keep track of my goals. For my long-term goal of making a webtoon, I 
    keep all the information about the webtoon, its chapters, future plans, etc in a platform called <u>Notion</u>.

    </section>
    <h2 class="colored">Stress</h2>
          <h3>What is stress?</h3>
          <p>Stress is the biological "fight or flight response" where your body informs you when you are in danger when
            you are running away from a 10 foot tall bear.     
            However, it can be quite the issue when you happen to NOT be running away from a 10 foot tall bear. 
        </p>
        <br>
          <h3>How do I experience and manage stressâ€”A person reflection.</h3>
          <p>The stress I feel often stems from factors related to my academic responsibilities. Especially when I struggled to manage my time and I procrastinated a lot. Recently, I have begun to finish tasks as soon as I get them or atleast to the best of my ability to reduce the stress I would have felt with those tasks always in my mind. 
<br>
<br> 
For stress factors that I cannot control, I try to distract myself towards a personal project that I enjoy. For example, making a piece of art, working on my book, or working on my video game. Focusing my stress towards a productive personal task helps me calm myself down while not simply ignoring my stress like I would do if I distracted myself with social media of sorts.
