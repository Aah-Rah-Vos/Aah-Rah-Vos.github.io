    <h2 class="colored">My Skills</h2>
    <p>Over the span of this course, I became aware of the transferable skills I had already developed and those I have yet to.
      Skills like critical thinking, and computer skills were ones I developed from previous projects. Despite some of the skills like 
      collaboration that I already involved myself in, they are not aspects of myself I am absolutely great at. Which is why they are skills 
      I must focus more on.

    <h2 class="colored">Resume</h2>
    <p>This resume is a tailored one to fit the application to a summer student job in Informational Technology.
    Making a resume really made me learn how I can effectively format and market my skills to a specific target job. 
    I have saved a "master" resume file which I can alter to fit each and every job I apply to.
