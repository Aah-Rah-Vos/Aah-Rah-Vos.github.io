    <h2 class="colored">My Skills</h2>
    <p>Over the span of this course, I became aware of the transferable skills I had already developed and those I have yet to.
      Skills like critical thinking, and computer skills were ones I developed from previous projects. Despite some of the skills like 
      collaboration that I already involved myself in, they are not aspects of myself I am absolutely great at. Which is why they are skills 
      I must focus more on.

    <h2 class="colored">Resume</h2>
    <p>This resume is a tailored one to fit the application to a summer student job in Informational Technology.
    Making a resume really made me learn how I can effectively format and market my skills to a specific target job. 
    I have saved a "master" resume file which I can alter to fit each and every job I apply to.

    <h2 class="colored">Cover Letter</h2>
    <p>While I was aware of what a resume was, the idea of a cover letter was quite new to me at the beginning of the course. 
      Through the lesson, I learnt that a cover letter is a simple letter addressed to the employer highlighting my skills and why I would be a good fit to the role. This cover letter 
      is a specific one tailored towards my application to a summer part-time job in Informational Technology. While I did recently apply for a part-time job at Aldo, I believe I wrote a better letter in my IT application.

    <h2 class="colored">Budget</h2>
    <p>Until I actually began planning my budget for the first year of post-secondary, I never even thought of the ways my money could be spent.
      I did not even think about how I would have to spend money on mobile network, especially since I would need it for academic work. Like this, I 
      also failed to plan how exactly I would get the money I need. Having a budget down really made me realize and begin to work on these areas of financial need early.
